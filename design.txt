Goal: a minimal bullshit low level c-like language that is concise and easily understood

TODO:
 * Should a variant of const and volatile be added?
 * Is multiple return values necessary, or could it be substituted for optional/variant return values?
 * Should enums be a concept in this language, or should there be a more general structure for allowing enum like 
   groups of any types of constants
 * Unions or compiler directive?

Differences between Gremlin and C
 * No header files or forward declarations
 * Functions are overloadable
 * Vararg functions are type safe and allow random access and introspection of the passed variables
 * Runtime and compile time type information is supplied
 * All code can be run at compile time
 * The build process is controlled by the program itself
 * The program being compiled can catch compile events and modify the compilation process
 * A defer "function" is supplied, which makes it possible to execute code on scope exit
 * Name before type
 * Pointers are declared with ampersand instead of asterisk (i.e. name: & type, instead of name: * type)

IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to feedback, clunky function pointer syntax and some weird differences between function and
                variable declarations
