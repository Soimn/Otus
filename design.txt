Goal: a minimal bullshit low level c-like language

NOTE:
 * Due to the wide spread usage of the C pointer synax, the same syntax is used in this language (despite its 
   flaws)

TODO:
 * Should a union type decl be added or should there be a tag that conveys joint memory
 * Should a variant of const and volatile be added?
 * Find out if there is a better syntax for pointers than the one in C
 * Should multiple variable declaration via a ',' separated list be removed?

Differences between Gremlin and C
 * No header files or forward declarations
 * Functions are overloadable
 * Vararg functions are type safe and allow random access and introspection of the passed variables
 * Runtime type information is supplied
 * All functions that are "pure" (meaning they do not affect global state) can be run at compile time as long as    
   all the parameters are known at compile time
 * Macros are type safe
 * The build process is controlled by the program itself
 * The program being compiled can catch compile events and modify the compilation process
 * Functions can return multiple values (structured bindings)
// * Implicit casting is only performed on void* and core types (unless additional casting rules are specified)
//   all signed integers are implicitly upcast to I64, all unsigned integers are upcast to U64, F32 is upcast to 
//   F64, any pointer can be implicitly cast to void* and back
 * A defer "function" is supplied, which makes it possible to execute code on scope exit

--- Type and name order ---
Types are specified before names for readability. This does however complicate parsing.
type identifer instead of indentifier: type
The keyword 'var' is therefore used to signify an inferred type

IMPORTANT TODO: Is structured bindings a good solution to the multiple return value problem and how should 
                captures be specified

--- Structured bindings ---
NOTE: Structured bindings are used to group variables to enable muliple return values and an alternative way of 
      multiple assignment. Variables declared or assigned this way are not special and may be accessed as if they 
      were declared separately.
NOTE: Structured bindings can be aliased with the using keyword, the elements in the binding must be named ot be 
      accessible, and can be accessed by using the dot operator on the alias followed by the name of the element

NOTE: Structured bindings are only allowed in assignment and as return values from a function. This is done to 
      avoid complexity.

return_value: [type_0, type_1, ... type_n] Function () { ... }
decl and assignment: [type_0 name_0, type_1 name_1, ... type_n name_n] = Function();
assignment: [i, s, b] = Function();
expression: [int i, String s, bool b] = [1, "Hello", true];

--- Grammar ---
NOTE: This grammar is not complete and serves only the purpose of making the construction of the parser simpler
NOTE: {}? signifies an optional expression
NOTE: {} x N signifies the the expression is repeated N times
NOTE: {} x [a, b] signifies the expression is repeated between a and b times (inclusive)
NOTE: {} x <a, b> signifies the expression is repeated between a and b times (exclusive)
NOTE: / signifies a specialication. e.g. indetifier/IsType matches an indentifier which fulfills IsType
NOTE: ! signifies logical negation
NOTE: | signified logical or
